There are no prerequisites for this course.

## Course Description

iTeams projects begin with your choice of a technology or problem and conclude with your reporting on clear and actionable next steps for an organization that solves a real-world problem. Your goal is to conquer a problem (being right about *how* at the start is immaterial). You’ll report on a space ripe with opportunities for impact. Whether you worked with a technology from a lab or chose to work on one of the problems we scope for you every semester, your final report will have to outline the way in which technology offers a *provable* advantage and enough of a competitive head start to ensure the survival of an organization that solves a problem — including the necessary steps to seize that advantage.

## Class Goals and Expectations

Our goal is to equip you with life-long skills for innovating. We do so by reproducing real-world innovating conditions. If we succeed, next time you engage in innovation (while entrepreneur-ing or not), it will feel like déjà-vu.

Specifically, in iTeams, you’ll learn how to manage uncertainty; how to scale up an idea out of your head all the way up to impact; how to specify technology to solve problems that matter; and how to communicate meaningfully across disciplinary divides to push an innovating agenda. These are skills you can practice and get better at over time. At the root of it all lie two rather simple principles common to finance and engineering: *in the face of uncertainty, diversification is the only rational choice*; and *you solve problems no one has solved before by imagining the problem solved and working backwards from that (not from some wild guess at a solution).*

iTeams alumni have used these skills and principles in myriad ways in their careers. Some have teamed up with MIT Labs to move technology to impact. iTeams students have gone on to create a host of companies, including LiquiGlide, Lantos, Manus Biotechnology, Viznu, Eta devices, Arctic Sand, Myomo, C2sense, Pipeguard Robotics, Revivemed, LuxLabs, Open Water, and others, as well as several ongoing “proto startups.” Others have used what they learned to find another technology to start a venture (Ayar Labs, Quanttus, etc.; many have gone on to use the skills they acquired in the class to found startups of their own or participate in early-stage technology ventures, pursue scientific careers in academia or industry, enter venture capital, join venture creation labs, and innovate within established companies.

The iTeams experience is valuable across many career paths: finance, business, policy, social impact, science, engineering, and beyond. The principles are the basis for several innovating factories. iTeams is valuable to participating labs, too; they help us make this educational experience possible, expose their graduate students to tech-to-impact, and discover opportunities for impact ahead for their work.

## Class Structure

### Project and Team Formation

By the third week, after we’ve clarified what we all understand about technology and the problem, described how to define an exploration, and the skills involved in exploring for opportunities, we’ll present the technology challenges available this semester. Some will be presented directly by labs. We’ll help you come ready to ask and interact with lab members. After that, you’ll have to declare your project preferences. ***We will form teams based on your preferences, feedback from the labs, and our commitment to offer you a cross-disciplinary experience.***

We ask that you approach the project with a mix of enthusiasm, skepticism, and spirit of inquiry (not the way advocates or consultants would approach the projects)—much as you would if you wanted to figure out whether you should expend your own resources on it. After all, there’s no greater waste than the waste of one’s most precious resource—your own time!.

### Use of Class Meeting Times

We have two scheduled times each week. We’ll use the Tuesday time to introduce the week’s content and the Friday time to discuss the content and for hands-on work in which we will collectively apply that content to the term’s projects. Our Friday sessions are highly interactive and choreographed to deliver on cross-team learning objectives.

### Readings

Throughout the semester, there are various links to readings, lecture notes, and handouts.

#### Course Text

- *Innovating: A Doer’s Manifesto for Starting from a Hunch, Prototyping Problems, Scaling Up, and Learning to Be Productively Wrong* by Luis Perez-Breva. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2017. ISBN: 9780262536127. \[[MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262536127/)\]

### Presentations

iTeams presentations are *not* for pitch practice; they are made to audiences ready to give feedback.

- **“Being Wrong” Presentation**: This is your first opportunity as a team to explore the readiness (or lack thereof) of the technology or problem with which you are working. Audience: peers and one guest.
- **Mid-Term Evaluation**: 2-minute PowerPoint overview backed by evidence of *three* distinct opportunities for your project, followed by interaction with guests. Audience: select group of iTeams “friends” (e.g., innovators, VCs, entrepreneurs, alumni, and domain experts).
- **Mingling Event Presentation**: 2-minute PowerPoint overview of your final report, followed by 1-on-1 discussions with guests. Presentations ought to include 3 distinct opportunities and clear steps to reduce uncertainty. This is the last opportunity to gather information about the space of opportunity from people in the audience.

Contrary to what most seem to assume, you’re not luring investors every time you explain a project. If your project is truly worth your time, the so-called “elevator pitch” will be the rarest of the presentations you’ll do. If you prepare to describe your concept genuinely through *storytelling*, and you assume your audience’s questions will not just be motivated by gauging a potential investment, you’ll succeed at presenting every time. Even investors will be compelled to ask questions that are better for you. That’s what our daring 2020 students got to practice while inspiring nearly 300 middle schoolers. It was so wildly successful, we did it again in 2022 and in 2023, and plan to repeat it this year.

- **Final 1-on-1 Presentation**: 30-minute overview of project outcomes and your recommendation in a discussion with the course faculty and up to 2 select guests.

### Assignments and Practice Sheets

Assignments and practice sheets are designed for you to practice skills and make progress with your project. Specific assignment instructions will be shared after team formation.

#### Final Deliverables

- **Final Technology-problem Whitepaper and** ***Scale Up*** **Report:** 5-to-10-page written report that establishes the connection between a problem and a set of technologies and signals a *robust* space of opportunity. The report must include how the technology you chose to work on may help seize that space, and a recommendation for immediate next steps and medium/long-term milestones. These deliverables will be given to the course faculty and PI, and to MIT’s Technology Licensing Office when appropriate. The report should document:
    - 3 distinct opportunities that may be seized with adequate evolution of technology and market understanding, described by their attractiveness, organizational model, and structure.
    - An outline for a  “build-to-kill-plan,” including a map of decisions/uncertainties that chart options to evolve your project to several distinct and impactful destinations.
    - Considerations about the organizational model suited to act on your next steps, including (among others) funding, research and development, and organizational elements.
- **Final Short Presentation (mingling event)**: 2-minute presentation with Q&A to a full middle school student body. *Spread STEM, Spread Impact.*
- **Final 1-on-1 Presentation**: 30-minute overview of project outcomes and your recommendation in a discussion with the course faculty and up to 2 select guests.

*It is entirely acceptable for your team to come to a well-researched conclusion that no avenue to impact for the technology exists.*

**What is a good idea? Can you tell them apart at the start?**

- If your definition of a good idea alludes to any measure  (user count, number of likes, validation, …) that can only be obtained when you are done then
    - you need a time machine to tell good and bad ideas apart
    - or else you are just guessing.
- Most people waste valuable time perfecting their guess for what the most convenient future will look like and put no time in perfecting the hunch they started with.

**Your job isn’t to be right about some idea you just had, but to future-proof your hunch so you can be successful at solving a real problem.**

- You’ll have to accept that the problem or idea you’re working with now is still blurry, incomplete, wrong,… ***it is a hunch***. *It needs work.*

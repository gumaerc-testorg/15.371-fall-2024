- What do we (each of us) mean by problem? Technology? Innovation? impact?
- What is a problem?
    - If the problem is yet to be solved, can you expect it to have a clear statement yet?   
        Do you think you’ll describe it the same way after working a bit on it?
    - If you already know the *user* are you still talking about a problem or have you moved on to talk about a product?
- What is a technology?
    - Do you need to have the technology figured out and ready before you begin? Does it need to be new? 
    - Is research the same as technology?   
        Is a product the same as technology?
- What do you mean by impact?

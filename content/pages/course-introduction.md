What if technologies were like untapped superpowers – and your job was to find out how to use them to solve problems that matter? You’ll work on technology projects from MIT Labs on a multi-disciplinary team with peers from across the Institute. *We care about exploring together a path to meaningful impact that leverages deep tech to do well by doing good.*

*iTeams is different from entrepreneurship offerings to which it is often compared.* Typically, entrepreneurship and innovation classes require that you bring your own product idea, with which you imagine a product and pretend-play pitching to investors and others. We have no such requirement. In iTeams, all you have at the outset is uncertainty, *everything is a variable,* and your job is to make decisions that reduce both uncertainty and risk. No other innovation or entrepreneurship class teaches you how to explore opportunities and scale up organizations without a pre-conceived product idea.

We’ll show you how to explore several possible “destinations” at once, and how to take technology to society to solve a problem that’s *meaningful*, not just one that presents a product opportunity. Doing so is a significant scale-up endeavor driven by a desire to build systems that *don’t fail* in ways that could have been predicted. We’ll teach you how to home in on the skill of advancing by being *productively wrong*. You’ll learn to explore whitespaces and plan robust, de-risked, trailblazing organizations that solve problems that matter.

In the past decade, students have shepherded more than two hundred MIT technologies to impact via iTeams and then have applied the same skills repeatedly to their innovating adventures. Approximately 40 new, enduring deep-tech companies have emerged directly from their work in iTeams.

In ITeams, you’ll put to the test some deeply held beliefs about entrepreneurship and innovation. We will show you a different way to use the skills and knowledge you acquire in your disciplinary training.

## Video Introduction and Modules

Prof. Perez-Breva gives an overview of Innovation Teams (iTeams) and explains how the iTeams approach differs from traditional entrepreneurship models in [this series of short videos](https://ocw-studio.odl.mit.edu/sites/innovation-teams/content/33ff81fb-0b04-4a38-bec0-060ac3912238/).
